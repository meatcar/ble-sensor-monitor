# Settings for the MQTT Client. Currently only these three are supported
mqtt:
  # The MQTT broker to connect to
  server: tcp://mqtt:1883
  # The Topic path to subscribe to. Be aware that you have to specify the wildcard.
  topic_path: home/TheengsGateway/BTtoMQTT/+
  # Optional: Regular expression to extract the device ID from the topic path. The default regular expression, assumes
  # that the last "element" of the topic_path is the device id.
  # The regular expression must contain a named capture group with the name deviceid
  # For example the expression for tasamota based sensors is "tele/(?P<deviceid>.*)/.*"
  # device_id_regex: "(.*/)?(?P<deviceid>.*)-.*"
  # The MQTT QoS level

  # Set the timeout to -1 to disable the deletion of metrics from the cache. The exporter presents the ingest timestamp
